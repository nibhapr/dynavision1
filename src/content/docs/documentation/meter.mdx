Technical Specifications:

| Digital multimeter        |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Voltage Measurement Range | Specifies the range of voltages the meter can accurately measure, often divided into AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) voltage ranges.                                       |
| Current Measurement Range | Indicates the range of currents the meter can measure, usually in AC and DC modes. It may have different ranges like mA (milliamps) or A (amps)                                             |
| Resistance Measurement    | Specifies the range of resistances the meter can measure, often from ohms to megaohms (Ω to MΩ).                                                                                            |
| Accuracy                  | Describes how closely the measured value corresponds to the actual value. Accuracy is usually given as a percentage of the reading or as a number of digits                                 |
| Display Resolution:       | Indicates the smallest change in measurement that the meter can display. For instance, a 3½ digit display can show values up to 1999, while a 4½ digit display can show values up to 19999. |
| Sampling Rate             | Refers to how quickly the meter can take measurements per second. This is important for capturing transient signals accurately                                                              |
| Safety Ratings            | Specifies the safety standards the meter complies with, such as CAT (Category) ratings for protection against electrical hazards                                                            |
| Additional Functions      | Many DMMs come with additional measurement capabilities such as frequency, capacitance, temperature, diode testing, continuity testing, and sometimes even data logging.                    |
| Power Source              | Indicates the type and number of batteries required for operation                                                                                                                           |
| Size and Weight           | Physical dimensions and weight of the meter, which can affect its portability and ease of use.                                                                                              |
| Interface                 | Some DMMs may have USB or Bluetooth interfaces for connecting to a computer or mobile device, enabling data logging or remote monitoring                                                    |
| Environmental Conditions  | Operating temperature range and humidity levels within which the meter can perform reliably.                                                                                                |
